# BitScopeMicroMount
 A designer frame to hold the Bitscope Micro with Hammerhead BNC interface.

The BitScope Micro is a tiny USB-connected oscilloscope with two analog channels, six logic channels, 20 MHz bandwidth, and 40 MSps logic capture.  It's a great little tool.

If you want to use it on your bench, however, you might find (like I did) that it's a bit clumsy.  Probe leads tend to pull it around, and then it's knocking small parts off onto the floor.  So, I designed this X-frame holder for it.  Instead of a bland rectangular box that hides the cool blinky LEDs, this open frame solution offers several benefits:

- it's open to the air, so there's no danger of heat accumulation
- you can see the LED indicators functioning
- It presents the Hammerhead BNCs and digital pins above the desktop, which is very convenient
-
